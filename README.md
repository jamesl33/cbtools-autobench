cbtools-autobench
-----------------

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jamesl33/cbtools-autobench.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jamesl33/cbtools-autobench)

An automatic benchmarking tools designed to benchmark Couchbase tools, written with the intention of producing reliable
benchmarks and to reduce the feedback loop for changes made to performance critical components.

Building
--------

Go modules are used to build `cbtools-autobench`, therefore, building is a simple as running `go build`. For convenience
a `Makefile` has also been provided which can be used via `make build`.

Usage
-----

This tool is broken down into three main components which take place when performing benchmarking:
- Provisioning the cluster
    - Installing dependencies on cluster nodes
    - Installing Couchbase Server
    - Initializing each node
    - Initializing the cluster
    - Creating the test bucket
- Loading benchmarking data
    - Modifying eviction pager (too speed up load times)
    - Loading test data (using multiple instances of `cbbackupmgr`)
    - Resetting the eviction pager (to avoid affecting benchmark results)
    - Compacting the test bucket
- Running benchmarks
    - Backup
    - Restore

Provisioning is done via the `cbtools-autobench provision` sub-command which accepts a configuration (see Configuration
for more information) which describes which servers to user for the backup/cluster nodes.

Loading the benchmarking data will be done the first time provision completes, and may be triggered manually (for
example to load a different dataset without provisioning the cluster again) using the `--load-only` flag.

Benchmarks may be run using the `cbtools-autobench benchmark [backup|restore]` sub-command which accepts a configuration
which indicates the number of benchmark iterations to run, along with the required configuration for `cbbackupmgr`.

Below is an example use case for `cbtools-autobench` using the following configuration:

```yaml
ssh:
  username: "root"
  private_key: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
blueprint:
  cluster:
    package_path: "/tmp/couchbase-server-enterprise_7.0.0-5160-ubuntu18.04_amd64.deb"
    nodes:
      - host: "192.168.122.154"
      - host: "192.168.122.68"
    bucket:
      type: "ephemeral"
      eviction_policy: "noEviction"
      data:
        items: 500_000
        size: 25
  backup_client:
    host: "192.168.122.215"
    package_path: "/tmp/couchbase-server-enterprise_7.0.0-5160-ubuntu18.04_amd64.deb"
benchmark:
  iterations: 3
  cbbackupmgr_config:
    archive: "archive"
    repository: "repo"
```

This testing was run locally using virtual machines but may just as easily be run using AWS/GCE by changing the
addresses and ensuring the SSH credentials are valid.

Configuration
-------------

Currently, all sub-commands require a configuration to be provided; this configuration describes multiple things
required for provisioning/benchmarking. For example:
- SSH credentials (for connecting to the remote servers)
- Cluster blueprint (describes the setup of the cluster including benchmarking dataset)
- Backup client blueprint
- Benchmark configuration (number of iterations along with `cbbackupmgr` configuration i.e. environment/threads/flags)

Below is a complete rundown of all the available values which may be set in the configuration file, any and all unknown
configuration will be ignored by `cbtools-autobench`.

```yaml
ssh:
  # Username used when connecting via SSH to all servers, therefore, must be the same (usually 'root')
  username: ""
  # Some cloud providers require authentication via a private key (path to a file on disk)
  private_key: ""
  # Password for the private key (optional)
  private_key_passphrase: ""
blueprint:
  # Describing the cluster/dataset
  cluster:
    # A path to a package archive i.e. .deb/.rpm
    #
    # Will be installed on all the cluster nodes
    package_path: ""
    # List of nodes which will be used to create the cluster
    nodes:
    # Hostname of the server, used to connect via SSH (may be an IP address)
    - host: ""
    # The path where KV data will be stored, configured using 'node-init' from 'couchbase-cli'
      data_path: ""
    # Describing the benchmarking bucket
    bucket:
      # Conditionally limit the number of vBuckets (zero value disables limit)
      vbuckets: 0
      # The bucket type i.e. couchbase/ephemeral
      type: ""
      # The eviction policy i.e. valueOnly/fullEviction/noEviction/nruEviction
      eviction_policy: ""
      # Whether to compact the bucket after the data load phase completes
      compact: false
      # Whether the bucket should have Point-In-Time capability
      pitr_enabled: false
      # The granularity of Point-In-Time backups
      pitr_granularity: 0

When running benchmarks, it's important that the information in the configuration is accurate, otherwise the generated
benchmarking report may contain some invalid/stale information.

Contributing
------------

To contribute to this repository please feel free to create pull requests on GitHub using a fork of this repository.
Make sure you have configured the git hooks so that the code is linted and formatted before uploading the patch.

For the git hooks the following dependencies are required:

```
gofmt
gofumpt
goimports
golangci-lint
```

Once you have installed the dependencies set the git hooks path by using the command below:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Coding style

In this section we will cover notes on the exact coding style to use for this codebase. Most of the style rules are
enforced by the linters, so here we will only cover ones that are not.

### Documenting

- All exported functions should have a matching docstring.
- Any non-trivial unexported function should also have a matching docstring. Note this is left up to the developer and
  reviewer consideration.
- Docstrings must end on a full stop (`.`).
- Comments must be wrapped at 120 characters.
- Notes on interesting/unexpected behavior should have a newline before them and use the `// NOTE:` prefix.
